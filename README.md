### Here is a bitcoin wallet implementation in Python according to the BIP 32 and the BIP 39

What we have done : 

- Interactive program in python

- Create a random integer that can be used as a seed to a wallet securely

- Represent this seed in binary and cut it in 11-bit batches

- Assign to each batch a word according to the list BIP 39 and display the seed in mnemonic 

- Allowing the import of a mnemonic seed
